# Shipment Code Generation Walkthrough

## Changes
- Modified [src/app/api/users/route.ts](file:///Users/wissamalmsalati/Documents/alwala-project/alwala-server/src/app/api/users/route.ts) to generate shipment codes for all supported regions with specific formats when a new customer is created.
- The codes are generated sequentially based on the last existing China code (`KO219-FLL`).
- All codes share the same sequence number.

## Code Formats
- **China**: `KO219-FLL` + Number (e.g., `KO219-FLL101`)
- **Dubai**: `BSB FLL D` + Number (e.g., `BSB FLL D101`)
- **USA**: `Global FLL ` + Number (e.g., `Global FLL 101`) (Note the space)
- **Turkey**: `ABUHAJ FLL` + Number (e.g., `ABUHAJ FLL101`) (No space)

## Verification Results
### Automated Verification
- The code compiles successfully.
- The logic ensures that if a customer is created, all 4 codes are generated with the correct prefixes and saved to the database.

### Manual Verification
1.  Log in as an Admin.
2.  Go to the Users page.
3.  Create a new user with the role `CUSTOMER`.
4.  Verify in the database or customer details that the user has the codes in the formats listed above.
